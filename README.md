Hospital Management System

I have developed a Hospital Management System as my academic project, aimed at simplifying and digitizing healthcare administration. This system simulates real-world hospital operations and is designed with scalability, usability, and data accuracy in mind.

What It Does

Admin Panel

Secure login and profile management for administrators

Doctor Management

Add, update, view, and delete doctor profiles

Patient Management

Register, update, view, and discharge patients

Manage patients grouped by family

Doctor Assignment

Assign or reassign doctors to patients efficiently

Data Handling

Save and load all patient data for persistence

Reports & Insights

Generate comprehensive management reports, including:

Total number of doctors

Patient count per doctor

Monthly appointments for each doctor

Patient based on illness type

Why It Matters

This system enhances hospital workflows, improves data accuracy, and supports informed decision-making through streamlined management features. By digitizing hospital operations, it contributes to more efficient healthcare delivery.
